This is the backend of a Telegram bot which stitches screenshots into long pictures for you. Check the bot [here](https://t.me/SStitcherBot).

This bot is built upon [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) library, which is a pure Python interface of the official [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api). The stitching process is powered by [opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).
